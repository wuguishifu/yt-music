# apollo-kore

`apollo-kore` exists only to expose client-safe Convex artifacts to shared apps/libs.

This project builds a `dist/` package from `apps/apollo` that contains:

- the generated `api` runtime module
- the generated `_generated` declaration files
- emitted declaration files for the server modules those generated types reference

This keeps client apps on the nice Convex API types without forcing Nx/TypeScript to compile the server source graph from `apps/apollo`.
